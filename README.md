## **Professional Experience**

### Security Specialist | Accenture | June 2024 - June 2025

I continued to lead security implementations and SSO services for all GE enterprise authentication systems <strong> as the sole engineer for 10+ months</strong> during a corporate reshuffling of GE IAM personnell into Accenture.


### **Software Engineering Specialist - SSO Team | General Electric Company | December 2021 â€“ June 2024**

I've been instrumental in maintaining and modernizing mission-critical SSO APIs serving over 80,000 employees across GE Corporate, GE Vernova, and GE Aerospace. 

* **Architected and delivered 14 SSO APIs** within an 11-month timeline while simultaneously managing legacy system migration (identity provider, database, codebase) for 15+ year old Java systems.
* Ensured **99% uptime** since production deployment, seamlessly handling high-volume usage during GE's corporate restructuring.
* Acted as the sole developer for an extended period (10 months), managing critical authentication services without any service interruption amidst GE/Accenture transition.
* Implemented **mutual authentication (mTLS)** architecture using OpenSSL, Terraform, and Envoy, fortifying internal API traffic security with annual manual certificate rotation.
* Modernized CI/CD infrastructure by migrating from Jenkins to TeamCity, creating efficient deployment pipelines for all three business units through custom build scripts and templates.
