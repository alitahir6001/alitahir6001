* Ensured **99% uptime** since production deployment, seamlessly handling high-volume usage during GE's corporate restructuring.
* Acted as the sole developer for an extended period (10 months), managing critical authentication services without any service interruption amidst GE/Accenture transition.
* Implemented **mutual authentication (mTLS)** architecture using OpenSSL, Terraform, and Envoy, fortifying internal API traffic security with annual manual certificate rotation.
* Modernized CI/CD infrastructure by migrating from Jenkins to TeamCity, creating efficient deployment pipelines for all three business units through custom build scripts and templates.
